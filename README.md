# Counting Program

This repository contains a counting program implemented in C. The program prompts the user for three inputs: the beginning number to start counting from, the ending number to stop counting at, and the increment number. It then uses the acquired data to perform a counting operation using a for loop and displays the results to the user.

## Key Features

- **User-friendly interface:** The program prompts the user for input and provides informative messages for incorrect responses.
- **Random number generation:** It generates random numbers within specified ranges to create diverse counting scenarios.
- **Error handling:** The program validates user input to ensure it is a number and provides error messages when necessary.
- **Modular design:** The code is organized into separate functions to enhance maintainability and allow for future enhancements.
- **Testability:** The program can be easily tested with different input values to verify correctness.

## Usage
